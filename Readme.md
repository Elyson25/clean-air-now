Clean Air Now: A Full-Stack MERN GIS Application

Live Application: [**https://clean-air-now.vercel.app/**](https://clean-air-now.vercel.app/)

**Clean You should replace `readme-screenshot.png` with an actual screenshot of your application's dashboard)*

**Clean Air Now** Air Now** is a responsive, full-stack web application designed to empower communities with real-time air quality data and a is a full-stack MERN application designed to empower communities with real-time, accessible, and actionable environmental data. It provides platform for reporting local pollution incidents. Leveraging the MERN stack, WebSockets for real-time communication, and Leaflet for interactive GIS an interactive GIS map to visualize the Air Quality Index (AQI) and allows users to report and view local pollution incidents as mapping, this project provides a centralized hub for environmental awareness and action.

## Key Features

* **Interactive GIS Map**: A live, interactiverender.com](<https://clean-air-now-server.onrender.com>)**

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Interactive GIS Map:** A dynamic and responsive map built with Leaflet, displaying the user's map powered by Leaflet that displays the user's current location with a custom high-accuracy marker.

**Real-Time Community Reporting**: Users can submit geo-tagged incident reports (e.g., illegal burning). New reports are broadcast live location and community-submitted incident reports.

* **Real-Time AQI Monitoring:** Fetches and displays real-time instantly to all connected users via Socket.IO, appearing on their maps without a page refresh.

* **Instant Air Quality Index data from the OpenWeather API for any point on the map, triggered by a simple click.

* Air Quality Index (AQI)**: Automatically fetches and displays the AQI for the user's location upon login. Users can also click anywhere on the map to get an instant AQI reading for that specific point, powered by the OpenWeather**Live Community Reporting:** Users can submit pollution incident reports with a description and location. New reports are broadcast instantly to all connected clients API.

* **Secure User Authentication**: Complete user management system with registration, login, and a secure "Forgot Password" email using **Socket.IO** without needing a page refresh.

* **Secure User Authentication:** Complete user system with JWT-based authentication for registration, login, and protected routes. Passwords are securely hashed with `bcryptjs`.
* flow. Authentication is handled with JSON Web Tokens (JWT) and hashed passwords (bcrypt).

* **Role-Based Admin Dashboard**: A secure, admin-only dashboard for viewing and managing all user-submitted reports, including the ability to**Role-Based Admin Dashboard:** A secure admin-only panel for viewing all user reports and moderating content by updating update a report's status (e.g., from "Submitted" to "Resolved").
* **Production a report's status (e.g., from "Submitted" to "In Review" or "Resolved").

* **-Ready Backend**: The backend is hardened with rate-limiting to prevent spam/abuse and server-side validation to ensure data integrity.Temporary Report Markers:** Publicly visible incident reports automatically disappear from the map after a configurable duration (e.g.,

* **Secure Password Reset:** A full-ployed on **Vercel**.

* **Backend:** A robust and secure RESTful API built with **Node.js**featured "Forgot Password" flow that sends users a secure, temporary token via email to allow them to reset their password.
